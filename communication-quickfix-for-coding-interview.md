# 🧠 15-Day Plan to Fix Your DSA Communication (Even If You’re Not Fluent in English)

If you're preparing for interviews at top tech companies like **Google, Meta, or Apple**, strong coding skills aren't enough. You must also be able to **explain your approach clearly and confidently**.

But what if you’re not fluent in English?

This plan is built exactly for you — especially if you're from a **non-English-speaking background** and want to communicate better in technical interviews.

---

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

✅ Speak your algorithm approach clearly  
✅ Use simple, structured phrases like a pro  
✅ Explain Brute → Optimal → Code → Complexity  
✅ Prepare with daily mock-style speaking drills

---

## 📅 The 15-Day Plan at a Glance

- **⏱️ Duration**: 60 minutes/day  
- **🧰 Tools**: LeetCode, YouTube, Notion/Google Docs, Voice Recorder  
- **🎯 Outcome**: Interview-ready DSA communication

---

## 🟢 Week 1: Clear Thinking → Clear Speaking

### ✅ Day 1: Start With Confidence
- **Topic**: Arrays  
- **Problem**: Two Sum (LeetCode #1)  
- **Goal**: Learn how to begin your explanation  
- **Phrase**: _“Let me walk you through the problem…”_  
- 🎥 [Watch: Neetcode - Two Sum](https://youtu.be/KLlXCFG5TnA)

---

### ✅ Day 2: Brute → Optimal Transition
- **Problem**: Best Time to Buy & Sell Stock  
- Practice both approaches clearly.  
- _“This is O(n²), but we can optimize using two pointers…”_

---

### ✅ Day 3: Dry Run + Complexity
- **Problem**: Valid Anagram  
- Verbally trace input like _“tea” and “eat”_  
- End with: _“Time: O(n), Space: O(1) if using fixed-size array”_

---

### ✅ Day 4: Use Real Examples
- **Problem**: Two Sum II  
- _“Let’s try [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9. First step…”_

---

### ✅ Day 5: Compare and Explain Tradeoffs
- **Problem**: Merge Intervals  
- _“Sorting helps us group intervals in O(n log n), reducing checks.”_

---

### ✅ Day 6: Mini Mock Interview
- Choose any problem so far  
- Explain full flow: Brute → Optimal → Code → Complexity  
- ⏺️ Record yourself for review

---

### ✅ Day 7: Self Reflection
- Review previous recordings  
- Re-explain one weak solution  
- Identify 3 improvement areas:
  - 🎯 Structure
  - 🎯 Fillers/Pauses
  - 🎯 Technical phrasing

---

## 🔵 Week 2: Structured Confidence & Real Mocks

### ✅ Day 8: Window Technique Verbalization
- **Problem**: Max Sum Subarray of Size K  
- _“We fix window size and slide it forward, tracking max sum…”_

---

### ✅ Day 9: Speak While You Solve
- **Problem**: Container With Most Water  
- _“Start with two pointers at both ends…”_

---

### ✅ Day 10: Handle Mistakes Gracefully
- **Problem**: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters  
- Learn to say:  
  - _“Let me rephrase that…”_  
  - _“I missed a case — let’s correct it…”_

---

### ✅ Day 11: Dry Run with Stack

---

### ✅ Day 12: Story-Based Linked List Explanation
- **Problem**: Reverse Linked List  
- Explain like a story: _“We move prev to current, current to next…”_

---

### ✅ Day 13: Full Mock Interview
- Pick a medium problem  
- Explain from scratch  
- Cover: Brute → Optimal → Code → Dry run → Complexity  
- ⏺️ Record and review or ask for feedback

---

### ✅ Day 14: Learn From Experts
- 🎥 [Watch: FAANG Mock Interview](https://youtu.be/pD95bRrsPOM)  
- Note: Pacing, phrasing, edge case handling  
- Mimic 1 problem using their style

---

### ✅ Day 15: Final Real Mock
